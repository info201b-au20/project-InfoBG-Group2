# Gun Violence and Police Shooting in the U.S.

## 1 Introduction
The U.S. is an exceptional country when it comes to guns. Itâ€™s one of the few countries in which the right to bear arms is constitutionally protected. But the relationship between U.S. and guns is in a crucial way, which indicates it is far and away from the most homicidal incidents among all of the developed nations. Moreover, the causation of the recent well-known Black Lives Matter movement drives us to further relate U.S. gun incidents with police gun shootings. Thus, it led us curious about public safety and injustice in the United States since it is affecting all parts of our population, ourselves included.

The data in this dataset was downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). In the following report, we will mainly use two datasets, US Police Shootings and US Gun Violence. [US Gun Violence](https://www.kaggle.com/ericking310/us-gun-violence) gathered by Eric Jing The CSV file contains data for all recorded gun violence incidents in the US between January 2013 to March 2018. The data consist of 240k incidents, with detailed information about each incident. [US Police Shootings](https://www.kaggle.com/ahsen1330/us-police-shootings) collected by Ahsen Nazir, a data analyst. The data is about police shootings in the United States across different states. The data also involves details about a race, whether the person was armed, threatening had a mental illness, etc. It contains 5924 observations and 15 features. One of the questions can be related to this dataset is whether or not specific racial groups are more subjected to police shootings.

- There are totally 53 types of high level characteristics. For a better visualization as a whole, rarer characteristics were grouped into a category named "other", but it doesn't mean the completely ignoring of those characteristics. In later data exploration, we will also zoom into this category.
- More than half of the gun violence incidents were resulted in either injury or deaths.
- When talking about gun violence, there are a also a lot of non-shooting incidents.
