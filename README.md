## Why are you interested in this field/domain?
- We are interested in public safety and injustice in the United States because it is affecting all parts of our population, ourselves included.

## What other examples of data driven projects have you found related to this domain?
- The CNN Guns Project
- Mass Shooting Statistics Data
- Keeping Our Schools Safe: A Plan for Preventing Mass Shootings and Ending All Gun Violence in American Schools - Everytown Research & Policy

## What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain?
- Do specific states have higher rates of shootings than other states?
- What law enforcement policies are in place in specific states with low vs. high rates of shootings?
- Are specific groups of people more likely to be targeted by law enforcement?

## Data Information:
- All of our data above are retrieved from the open datasets website, [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- [US Police Shootings](https://www.kaggle.com/ahsen1330/us-police-shootings) collected by Ahsen Nazir, a data analyst. The data is about police shootings in the United States across different states. The data also involves details about a race, whether the person was armed, threatening had a mental illness, etc. It contains 5924 observations and 15 features. One of the questions can be related to this dataset is whether or not specific racial groups are more subjected to police shootings.
- [Guns incident data](https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/guns-incident-data) collected by user named Aman Miglani. The data relevant to shootings in the United States for the year 2017. It contains 1008 observations and 12 features. The dataset would allow the group to understand how race, age, education plays a role in gun violence in the United States. 
- [US_Gun_Violence](https://www.kaggle.com/ericking310/us-gun-violence) gathered by Eric Jing. The datasets collected all the recorded gun violence incidents in the U.S. between January 2013 to March 2018. There are 239,677 observations and 29 features in the data. Question-related to the dataset could be What states have the highest incidents per capita per year? How has this metric changed over time?
- Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani compiled [US Mass Shootings](https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/us-mass-shootings-last-50-years) from multiple other datasets and sources to create a large data set with key points and information about mass shootings in the past 50 years. It contains 320 observations and 13 features. The question we can ask from the dataset is do specific states have higher rates of shootings than other states?
- [Crime and Incarceration in the US](https://www.kaggle.com/christophercorrea/prisoners-and-crime-in-united-states) collected by user ChrisC. It is about the statistics of crime and prisoner figures in different states from 2001-2017. It contains 816 observations and 17 features. Some of the questions we can ask are what is the relationship between incarceration rates and crime rates and does mass incarceration improve public safety.
- [Crime in Context](https://www.kaggle.com/marshallproject/crime-rates) collected by The Marshall Project. (Acquired from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting program's "Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest" database.) It is about the number of different types of violent crimes in police jurisdictions. It contains 2829 observations and 15 features. By using this datasets, it can help us dive into the questions like, are violent crimes in the U.S. rising or falling and do some specific areas have a higher rate of violent crimes than the others.
